        "This two-step model, called an Encoder–Decoder, works much better than trying to translate on the fly with a single sequence-to-sequence RNN (like the one represented on the top left), since the last words of a sentence can affect the first words of the translation, so you need to wait until you have heard the whole sentence before translating it. Seq-2-seq RNNs translate one word at a time where as encoder-decoder RNNs read & translate a sentence at a time\n",
