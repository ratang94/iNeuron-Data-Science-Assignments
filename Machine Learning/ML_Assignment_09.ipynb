        "**Ans:** Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning. In order to make machine learning work well on new tasks, it might be necessary to design  and train better features.\n",
        "      \n",
        "Feature engineering in ML consists of four main steps: Feature Creation, Transformations, Feature Extraction, and  Feature Selection. Feature engineering consists of creation, transformation, extraction, and selection of features, also known as variables, that are most conducive to creating an accurate ML algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Lets take a look at some Feature Engineering Types:**\n",
        "1. Imputation: Imputation deals with handling missing values in data. \n",
        "2. Discretization/Binning: Discretization involves essentially taking a set of values of data and grouping sets of them together in some logical fashion into bins (or buckets).\n",
        "3. Caategorical Encoding: Categorical encoding is the technique used to encode categorical features into numerical values which are usually simpler for an algorithm to understand. One hot encoding(OHE)  is a popularly used technique of categorical encoding. Here, categorical values are converted into simple numerical 1’s and 0’s without the loss of information.\n",
        "4. Feature Splitting: Splitting features into parts can sometimes improve the value of the features toward the target to be learned. For instance, Date might better contribute to the target function than Date and Time.\n",
        "5. Handling Outliers: Outliers are unusually high or low values in the dataset which are unlikely to occur in normal scenarios. Since these outliers could adversely affect your prediction they must be handled appropriately. The various methods of handling outliers include:\n",
        "a) Removal: The records containing outliers are removed from the distribution. However, the presence of outliers over multiple variables could result in losing out on a large portion of the datasheet with this method.\n",
        "b) Replacing values: The outliers could alternatively bed treated as missing values and replaced by using appropriate imputation.\n",
        "c) Capping: Capping the maximum and minimum values and replacing them with an arbitrary value or a value from a variable distribution.\n",
        "d) Discretization\n",
        "6. Scaling: Feature scaling is done owing to the sensitivity of some machine learning algorithms to the scale of the input values. This technique of feature scaling is sometimes referred to as feature normalization. The commonly used processes of scaling include:\n",
        "a) Min-Max Scaling: This process involves the rescaling of all values in a feature in the range 0 to 1. In other words, the minimum value in the original range will take the value 0, the maximum value will take 1 and the rest of the values in between the two extremes will be appropriately scaled.\n",
        "b) Standardization/Variance scaling: All the data points are subtracted by their mean and the result divided by the distribution's variance to arrive at a distribution with a 0 mean and variance of 1.\n",
        "7. Variable Transformation: Variable transformation techniques could help with normalizing skewed data. One such popularly used transformation is the logarithmic transformation. Logarithmic transformations operate to compress the larger numbers and relatively expand the smaller numbers. This in turn results in less skewed values especially in the case of heavy-tailed distributions. Other variable transformations used include Square root transformation and Box cox transformation which is a generalization of the former two.\n",
        "8. Feature Creation: Feature creation involves deriving new features from existing ones. This can be done by simple mathematical operations such as aggregations to obtain the mean, median, mode, sum, or difference and even product of two values. These features, although derived directly from the given data, when carefully chosen to relate to the target can have an impact on the performance\n"

        "**Ans:** Feature selection is the process of reducing the number of input variables when developing a predictive model. It is desirable to reduce the number of input variables to both reduce the computational cost of modeling and, in some cases, to improve the performance of the model. There are three types of feature selection:\n",
        "- **Wrapper methods** (forward, backward, and stepwise selection): In wrapper methods, we try to use a subset of features and train a model using them. Based on the inferences that we draw from the previous model, we decide to add or remove features from your subset. The problem is essentially reduced to a search problem. These methods are usually computationally very expensive.\n",
        "- **Filter methods** (ANOVA, Pearson correlation, variance thresholding): Filter methods are generally used as a preprocessing step. The selection of features is independent of any machine learning algorithms. Instead, features are selected on the basis of their scores in various statistical tests for their correlation with the outcome variable. The correlation is a subjective term here.\n",
        "- **Embedded methods** (Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree): Embedded methods combine the qualities’ of filter and wrapper methods. It’s implemented by algorithms that have their own built-in feature selection methods. Some of the most popular examples of these methods are LASSO and RIDGE regression which have inbuilt penalization functions to reduce overfitting. Lasso regression performs L1 regularization which adds penalty equivalent to absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. Ridge regression performs L2 regularization which adds penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of coefficients.\n",

        "**Ans:** Text classification is the problem of assigning categories to text data according to its content. The most important part of text classification is feature engineering: the process of creating features for a machine learning model from  raw text data. Example: Text cleaning steps vary according to the type of data and the required task. Generally, the string is converted to lowercase and punctuation is removed before text gets tokenized. Tokenization is the process of splitting a string into a list of strings (or “tokens”). We can create a list of generic stop words for the English vocabulary with NLTK (the Natural Language Toolkit), which is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing. Then we can remove these stop words. We need to be very careful with stop words because if you remove the wrong token you may lose important information. For example, the word “will” was removed and we lost the information that the person is Will Smith. With this in mind, it can be useful to do some manual modification to the raw text before removing stop words (for example, replacing “Will Smith” with “Will_Smith”). Stemming and Lemmatization both generate the root form of words. The difference is that stem might not be an actual word whereas lemma is an actual language word (also stemming is usually faster). Those algorithms are both provided by NLTK."
