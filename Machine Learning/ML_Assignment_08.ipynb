Also, feature construction is done by decomposing variables so that these new variables can be used in various machine learning algorithms such as the creation of Dummy Variables by performing Encoding. Other ways of constructing include deriving features from the pre-existing features and coming up with more meaningful features."

For example, pig is not higher than bird and lower than fish. Ordinal or Label Encoding can be used to transform non-numerical labels into numerical labels (or nominal categorical variables). Numerical labels are always between 1 and the number of classes. The labels chosen for the categories have no relationship. So categories that have some ties or are close to each other lose such information after encoding. The first unique value in your column becomes 1, the second becomes 2, the third becomes 3, and so on."

It refers to the family of algorithms that create new features using the existing features. These new features may not have the same interpretation as the original features, but they may have more explanatory power in a different space rather than in the original space. This can also be used for Feature Reduction. It can be done in many ways, by linear combinations of original features or by using non-linear functions.
