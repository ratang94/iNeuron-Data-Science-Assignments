We can use an if __name__ == \"__main__\" block to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported. When the Python interpreter reads a file, the __name__ variable is set as __main__ if the module being run, or as the module's name if it is imported"

In that case it will return the module in which we are working on. Suppose if the module is being imported from some other module, then name will have the name of that module from where the current module has been imported. The current module in which we are working is refer to the string `__main __`.\n",
