        "#### Q1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
        "**Ans:** Regular Expressions, also known as **`regex`** or **`regexp`**, are used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. It means that we can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular expressions. it helps the programmers to Write less and cleaner code. it also avoids multiple use of **`if/else`** statements. Regular expressions are a powerful feature of any language and solve a particular class of problems extraordinarily well. They can be used to validate user input, extract relevant data from a string, or even modify a string based on its contents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's regular expression library is called \"re\" and is based on Perl's regular expression engine, which is pretty much an industry standard now."

        "**Ans:** Both **`(ab)c+`** and **`a(bc)+`** are valid patterns. The difference between both these patterns is that in **`(ab)c+`** **`ab`** is a group whereas in **`a(bc)+`** **`bc`** is a group. Capturing groups are a way to treat multiple characters as a single unit. They are created by placing the characters to be grouped inside a set of parentheses."

They need not be be explicitly escaped by **`\\`** as in case of pattern texts in a raw string. Range in Regular Expressions Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a ‘-‘, for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59."

        "\n",

When one wants to match a literal backslash, it must be escaped in the regular expression. With raw string notation, this means r\"\\\\\". Without raw string notation, one must use 4 times back slashes"
