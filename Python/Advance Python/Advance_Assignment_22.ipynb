        "#### Q1. What are the benefits of the built-in array package, if any?\n",
        "**Ans:** Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name. In arrays, the elements can be accessed randomly by using the index number. Arrays allocate memory in contiguous memory locations for all its elements. Hence, there is no chance of extra memory being allocated in case of arrays. This avoids memory overflow or shortage of memory in arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists and NumPy Arrays usually are much better alternatives. That’s also the reason why rarely people knows Python has a built-in Array type.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, when something is restricted, it must bring some benefits. That is the so-call “trade-off”. In this case, Python Array will have a smaller size than Python List. This is demonstrated below."

The dtype of any numpy array containing string values is the maximum length of any string present in the array.Once set, it will only be able to store new string having length not more than the maximum length at the time of the creation.

Masking comes up when we want to extract, modify, count, or otherwise manipulate values in an array based on some criterion: for example, we might wish to count all values greater than a certain value, or perhaps remove all outliers that are above some threshold. In NumPy, Boolean masking is often the most efficient way to accomplish these types of tasks."
